RemoteSQL tool

One of the capstone projects from the Udemy "from zero to hero" python course.

By selecting an option from the menu, program use a mysql query to do the following actions:

1.Show all databases.
2.Create a database.
3.Delete a database.
4.Create a table.
5.View a tables.
6.Show fields in table.
7.Insert data into table.                  
8.SELECT (item or *) FROM table.
9.Add column to existing table.
10.Update data in column.
11.Delete column from existing table.

In this project i used library PrettyTable that is used to show tabular data in visually appealing ASCII tables.
